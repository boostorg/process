== `process_start_dir`

The easier initializer to use is `process_start_dir`:

[source,cpp]
----
asio::io_context ctx;
process ls(ctx.get_executor(), "/ls", {}, process_start_dir("/home"));
ls.wait();
----

This will run `ls` in the folder `/home` instead of the current folder.

WARNING: If your path is relative, it may fail on posix, because the directory is changed before a call to execve.
