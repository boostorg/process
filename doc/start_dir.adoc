== `process_start_dir`

The easier initializer to use is `process_start_dir`:

.example/start_dir.cpp:17-20
[source,cpp,indent=0]
----
include::../example/start_dir.cpp[tag=start_dir]
----

This will run `ls` in the folder `/home` instead of the current folder.

WARNING: If your path is relative, it may fail on posix, because the directory is changed before a call to execve.
