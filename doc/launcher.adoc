= Launcher

The process creation is done by a process_launcher. 
The constructor of `process` will use the default_launcher, which varies by system.
There are additional launcher available on most systems.

|===

A launcher is invoked through the call operator.

[source,cpp]
----
auto l = windows::as_user_launcher((HANDLE)0xDEADBEEF);
asio::io_context ctx;
boost::system::error_code ec;
auto proc = l(ctx, ec, "C:\\User\\boost\\Downloads\\totally_not_a_virus.exe", {});
----

The launcher will call certain functions on the initializer if they're present, as documented below.
The initializer are used to modify the process behaviour.


== Linux Launchers

The default launchers on linux open an internal pipe to communicate errors that occur after forking back to the parent process.

NOTE: A pipe can be used if one end is open on the parent, the other on the child.
This allows the parents to select on his pipe-end to know if the child exited.

This can be prevented by using the `fork_and_forget_launcher`. 
Alternatively, the `vfork_launcher` can report errors directly back to the parent process.

Thus some calls to the initializers occur after forking from the child process.

[source,cpp]
----
struct custom_initializer
{
    // called before a call to fork. A returned error will cancel the launch.
    template<typename Launcher>
    error_code on_setup(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line));

    // called for every initializer if an error occurred during setup or process creation
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_error(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line),
                  const error_code & ec);

    // called after successful process creation
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_success(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line));

    // called for every initializer if an error occurred when forking, in addition to on_error.
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_fork_error(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line),
                       const error_code & ec);


    // called before a call to execve. A returned error will cancel the launch. Called from the child process.
    template<typename Launcher>
    error_code on_exec_setup(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line));


    // called after a failed call to execve from the child process.
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_exec_error(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, const char * const * (&cmd_line));
};
----

The call sequence on success:

image::posix_success.svg[]

The call sequence when fork fails:

image::posix_fork_err.svg[]

The call sequence when exec fails:

image::posix_exec_err.svg[]

The launcher will close all non-whitelisted file descriptors after `on_exec_setup`.

== Windows Launchers

Windows launchers are pretty straight forward, they will call the following functions on the initializer if present.

[source,cpp]
----
struct custom_initializer
{
    // called before a call to CreateProcess. A returned error will cancel the launch.
    template<typename Launcher>
    error_code on_setup(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, std::wstring &cmd_line);

    // called for every initializer if an error occurred during setup or process creation
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_error(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, std::wstring &cmd_line,
                  const error_code & ec);

    // called after successful process creation
    template<typename Launcher>
    void on_success(Launcher & launcher, const filesystem::path &executable, std::wstring &cmd_line);

};
----

NTOE: All the additional launchers for windows inherit `default_launcher`.

The call sequence is as follows:
