`bind_fd` is a utility class to bind a file descriptor to an explicit file descriptor for the child process.

  // Inherit a newly opened-file as a set descriptor.
  /* This will pass a descriptor to "extra-output.txt" as 42 to the child process:

Using `bind_fd` can be used to inherit file descriptors explicitly, because no unused one will be.
